Habitica client is a little java client for habitica that uses Apache's HttpClient lib.
Its features : 
- Validate todos, habits and dailies
- Minimize in system tray (works well in Linux, I haven't tested for Windows and Mac OS X but I plan to to it soon).
- Uses the API v3
- That's all for the moment ! it is just a little project and I don't plan to add lots of features.
- Feel free to add features yourself !
