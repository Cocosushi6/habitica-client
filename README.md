Habitica client is a little java client for habitica that uses Apache's HttpClient lib.
Its features : 
- Validate todos, habits and dailies
- Minimize in system tray (works well in Linux, I haven't tested for Windows and Mac OS X but I plan to to it soon).
- Uses the API v3
- That's all for the moment ! it is just a little project and I don't plan to add lots of features.
- Feel free to add features yourself !

Note : The JXTrayIcon class is not from me, it has been written by Alexander Potochkin to allow using themeable Swing components in system tray (https://svn.java.net/svn/swinghelper~svn/trunk/src/java/org/jdesktop/swinghelper/tray/).
